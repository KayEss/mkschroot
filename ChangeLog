 Images that already existed when the script is run will now have `apt-get dist-upgrade` run on them.
 We now specify a directory within the `schroot` to use when running commands to avoid problems with running `mkschroot` from a location that doesn't exist within the chroot.
 The variant can now be specified and alters the way that `debootstrap` is run and the way that the `schroot` is entered.

 Added apt-cache compatible HTTP proxy handling and `/etc/apt/apt.conf` handling.
